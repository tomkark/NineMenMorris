# NineMenMorris-
A game of Nine Men Morris using Alpha-Beta pruning made by me.

The project was built offline without github as a result no commits are available, i have uploaded the project for people who 
are interested in the way the game was built and designed and the way the AB pruning was implemented inside the game.

There's also a "manual" in hebrew that describes the game and acts like a guide, unfortunately i did not find the right time to make an english version, yet i still think
the game is 100% self-explanatory and rules are available on the web.
